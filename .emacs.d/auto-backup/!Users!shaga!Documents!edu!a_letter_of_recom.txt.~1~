Professor Cronin,

My name is Shunsuke Haga. I took your JAVA Programming course last spring. You may remember me for the machine learning and voice recognition light bulb presentation which I worked on.  The JAVA course was a very challenging, yet interesting subject for me and I was proud of the bright A which I received in your class.

I know you are busy so I’ll get to the point. I am currently in the process of applying to Accelerated Computer Science Degree at Boston University Metropolitan College and I am trying to gather a few letters of recommendation. 
Because I enjoyed your class and teaching style so much, I decided to start by asking you. Would you be able to write me a strong letter of recommendation for my Boston University application?

I would be more than happy to meet with you at your convenience if that would be helpful. Of course I would also provide my personal statement, CV, and any other material that you would like.

If you don’t feel comfortable writing me a strong letter of recommendation, please don’t feel obligated to say yes. I completely understand.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request.


Sincerely,
Shunsuke Haga
