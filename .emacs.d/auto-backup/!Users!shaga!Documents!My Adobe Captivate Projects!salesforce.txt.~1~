::Multiple Choice:: What are the primary uses of tcpdump in the SOC? Select all that apply.
{=DDoS signature detection.
=Troubleshooting network issues.

::Multiple Choice:: Specifically when using the -w flag with tcpdump, what should you always do?
{=Use the -c flag.
~Make sure the interface on which you're capturing is in promiscuous mode.
~Make sure you're running as root or running the tcpdump with sudo.

::Multiple Choice:: Suppose you want to read a pcap file named foo.pcap, but you don't want to convert host addresses or port numbers to names. Which of the following tcpdump commands would accomplish this?
{=tcpdump -nnr foo.pcap -A
~tcpdump -nni foo.pcap
~tcpdump -nr foo.pcap
~tcpdump -vv foo.pcap -X}

::Multiple Choice:: You took a packet capture with the command “tcpdump -nn dst host 10.0.0.1 -c1000” and notice that there are numerous SYN/ACKs with acknowledgement number 1 in the output. How would you verify whether the acknowledgement numbers are actually 1?
{=Rerun the same command with -S appended.
~There is no need to rerun the command, as the output already shows all acknowledgements to be 1.
~Rerun the same command with -vvv appended.
~Rerun the same command  with -A appended.}
